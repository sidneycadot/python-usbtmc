Getting libusb for Microsoft Windows
------------------------------------

The Windows version of libusb 1.0 can be downloaded from https://libusb.info/. Go to the "Downloads" section,
and click "Latest Windows Binaries". This will download a compressed file containing no less than 12 (!)
versions of the libusb v1.0 DLL: compiled by six different compiler, for both 32-bits and 64-bits targets.

We'll be using the 64-bit version compiled with MinGW64:

* filename: mingw_libusb-1.0.dll
* file size: 228945 bytes
* md5sum: 37360951c9ecea62d4c5e2a094127aca
